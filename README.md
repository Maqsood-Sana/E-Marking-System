# E-Marking-System
Project Description: E-Marking System

The E-Marking System is a console-based application developed in C++ that automates the process of conducting and evaluating quizzes digitally. The system provides a simple yet effective interface for both students and administrators, ensuring secure access and smooth interaction.

Key Features

Admin Module:

Secure admin login using predefined credentials.

Ability to add quiz questions with multiple-choice options.

Option to view all registered students.

Student Module:

Secure login and registration system using file-based storage.

Option to attempt quizzes and automatically receive scores.

Password recovery feature for resetting forgotten credentials.

View individual quiz results anytime.

Data Handling:

All student data and credentials are stored in a text file (student_database.txt).

Quiz questions are managed dynamically in memory during runtime.

User Interface:

Smooth text-based menu system with animated ASCII logos for better visual appeal.

Robust input validation and password masking for enhanced usability.

Technologies Used

Language: C++

Libraries: <iostream>, <fstream>, <conio.h>, <thread>, <limits>

Storage: File Handling (student_database.txt)

Concepts Used: Arrays, Loops, Structures, Functions, File I/O, Input Validation, and String Handling

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to simulate a computerized exam system that can assist educational institutions in marking and managing quizzes automatically. It enhances efficiency by reducing manual grading effort while providing students with instant feedback.

Outcome

This system successfully demonstrates how automation and file handling can be used to develop lightweight academic tools for real-world educational environments. It offers a foundation that can later be extended with features like GUI, database integration, or online accessibility.
